												<p>When my mother Shreemati Sushila Tomar set the harmonium in my childhood, my heart would bloom. At the age of eleven, I started singing bhajans with her in the neighboring temple. I met my first Guru Rakesh Bansiwala Ji at the Bihari Ji Temple in Bharatpur. He runs a tea shop and the sweet sound of his flute in the temple still resonates today. When I learned a little from him, he started playing flutes in stories, hymns and temples. When stage performance was given in the town hall of Bharatpur, the audience used to give heavy applause.</p>

												<p>After this I was sent to Jaipur to do engineering like all students. Here I took admission in B.Tech, but I never liked it so I stopped going to college. In my mind, the flute would resonate daily, so here I started learning flutes from Sandeep Soni sir. During this time, friends in college helped a lot. They used to pay my fine with their pocket money. While training in B.Tech, I started lying at home and started training at Ravi Prasanna sir in Delhi. In two months of engineering training, I took 'Flute' training.The real struggle started after this.</p>
												<p>I used to travel 1300 km for a year for admission in Gurukul of Guruji Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia. Guruji does not give admission to anyone so easily, but the notes that I received from there, I would come to Bharatpur and practice them for six to eight hours daily. Panditji saw my ascendant and was happy. I told them that this is the last year of my engineering, if I do not get your support, then the engineering job will have to be done at the will of the family.</p>
												<p>When I struggled for a year, I used to read Swami Vivekananda's books. He was inspired by the fact that 'On the day that life does not come into difficulty, on that day understand that you are on the wrong path'.
													After much struggle, I got admission there. Where Guruji's disciples taught a lot. Guruji sent me to the Gurukul of Orissa. I took training there for six months. Then Panditji called me back to Mumbai. Stayed here from 2011 to 2015 and my dream of learning flute from Guruji was fulfilled. Guruji always says that music is our religion. It has to be done like worship.
